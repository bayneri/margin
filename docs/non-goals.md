# Non-goals

`margin` is intentionally narrow. It does not attempt to be:

- A general observability platform
- A replacement for Terraform
- A vendor-style monitoring agent
- A universal metrics abstraction layer
- A full SLO management suite for every GCP product

These exclusions keep the defaults safe, the configuration explicit, and the tool easy to audit.
